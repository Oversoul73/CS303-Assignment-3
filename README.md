CS-303 Assignment 2

Mohammadreza Akbari Lor

For the first part of the assignment in folder “CS-303 Assignment 3 Part 1”, only run the program and enter an expression. Only the symbol mentioned in the assignment are considered in the code. The expressions must be entered without space.

The program was not designed with error handling in mind as it was not required in the assignment. But as long as the instructions are followed no problem should occur.

Note that the program has to be run again from start for every expression that is entered.

The rest is self-explanatory as the images show.

For the second part of the assignment in folder “CS-303 Assignment 3 Part 2”, only run the program. There is a menu that serves to showcase the functionality of the Queue class. The data type for the node of the queue is int. But a non-negative integer is the desired user input since ‘-1’ is chosen as the sentinel value to be returned by the classes internal functions to denote when the queue is empty. 

Again, the program was not written with error handling or generic data types in mind as it was not required. But as long as the instructions are followed no problem should occur.

No functionality was defined for the classes besides a constructor and the five functions described in the assignment.

The rest is self-explanatory as the images show.
